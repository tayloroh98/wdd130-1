                        People said Korean can not eat meal without Kimchi. Because we eat Kimchi with every meals.<br>

Kimchi is made of vegetables mixed with spices such as red pepper powder, garlic, fish sauce etc. Koreans use all kinds of vegetables to make kimchi. The most common vegetables used are chinese cabbages, radishes, cucumbers, leeks and sesame leaves. There are 200 different kinds of kimchi in Korea.<br><br>

In the winter, kimchi is stored in giant clay pots. Some pots can be as tall as a child. They are buried in the earth up to their lids to keep them from freezing. The clay pots help to ferment the kimchi by allowing it to breathe. Nowadays, many houses have special refrigerators for kimchi instead of pots.

Bibimbap is served as a bowl of warm white rice topped with namul (sautéed and seasoned vegetables) or kimchi (traditional fermented vegetables) and gochujang (chili pepper paste), soy sauce, or doenjang (a fermented soybean paste). A raw or fried egg and sliced meat (usually beef) are common additions.
