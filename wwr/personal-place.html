                        Myeong-dong, which is visited by about 2 million people every day, is considered the "No. 1 tourist destination in Korea" in name and reality. Located in the middle of downtown Seoul, it serves as a hub for shopping, finance, and culture, and the streets are full of vitality throughout the day, with high-end department stores and restaurants, as well as various cosmetics brands, clothing brand stores, and movie theaters.<br><br> Myeong-dong was a residential area where people lived together during the Joseon Dynasty, but during the Japanese colonial era era, the Chungmuro area was developed into a commercial district and transformed into a commercial area. Since 1923, it has been established as Seoul's representative downtown area, and it has become similar to today through reconstruction projects promoted by the government right after the Korean War.

                        Changdeokgung Palace, a UNESCO World Heritage Site the most well-preserved palace of all the royal palaces from the Joseon Dynasty (1392 - 1910). This is where kings and their ministers discussed state affairs to effectively reign over the people, and where the royal family resided.<br><br>

Changdeokgung Palace was built in 1405 by King Taejong, the third ruler of Joseon. All palaces in Seoul were burnt down during the Japanese invasion in 1592 and Changdeokgung Palace became the first palace to be rebuilt in 1610. Since then, it became the primary palace for about 270 years where 13 kings including the last monarch dealt with state affairs.

                        The mass of islands draping off Korea’s southern coast fades into the Pacific, before coming to an enigmatic conclusion in the crater-pocked JEJU ISLAND, known locally as Jejudo (제주도). <br><br>This tectonic pimple in the South Sea is the country’s number-one holiday destination, particularly for Korean honeymooners, and it’s easy to see why – the volcanic crags, innumerable beaches and colourful rural life draw comparisons with Hawaii and Bali, a fact not lost on the local tourist authorities.
