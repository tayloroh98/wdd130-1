      <p>
        People basically have a desire for food, clothing, and shelter, but I think people also have a strong desire for travel.<br>
        It can be given as a reward to oneself who usually works hard, but it can be seen that many people spend too much time planning<br>
        the trip. These are activities they do to make themselves happy, and at some point, they can find themselves stressed out.<br>
        Therefore, the website will help you enjoy happier trips by reducing the effort and stress needed to go to a specific area<br>
        and make travel plans. To do so, we will gather necessary information such as culture, food, language, and scenery of a specific region<br>
        in one place so that people can use it conveniently.

      <h3>[Page 2]</h3>
      <p>
        The question I think of my visitors is usually 'What should I do when I go?', I think there are things like<br>
        "What about the people there?" and "What attractions do they have?" And my website will organize the information<br>
        needed to answer all of these questions in one place and help me solve them right here without having to go to another website<br>
        and find another.

      <h3>[Page 3]</h3>
      <p>
        The reason why my customers visit my website without visiting other websites is that our website has information <br>
        that other websites do not provide. If you look at most travel companies' websites, their information is place-oriented<br>
        and provides information focusing on entertainment because they are companies made for commercial purposes. <br>
        However, since my website is originally for the public interest, not for the personal interest, it can be seen that it is focused on<br>
        providing the information we need to travel rather than the information we want. At first, of course, it may be difficult for people to attract attention<br>
        because they cannot provide the information they want right away, but when they look at the website with an active attitude, <br>
        hey can see the authenticity of this website and I think this can gradually bring customers.
